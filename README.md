# SkillPay — Learn & Earn on Stellar

A blockchain-powered Learn & Earn platform. Mentors post challenges and escrow
rewards on Stellar via a Soroban smart contract. Learners submit real
projects (GitHub + live demo). The moment a mentor approves a submission,
the contract releases XLM straight to the learner's wallet — no manual
payout step.

## 1. Smart contract

```bash
cd contracts
# requires the Stellar CLI + Rust + the wasm32 target — see prerequisites below
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test                      # runs unit tests in skillpay-contract/src/test.rs
stellar contract build
```

**Prerequisites** (install once, on your own machine — not run by Claude):
- Rust (`rustup`)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/stellar-cli) (`cargo install --locked stellar-cli`)
- A funded Stellar testnet account for deployment (`stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet --fund`)

**Deploy to testnet:**

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/skillpay_contract.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

This prints a contract address (`C...`). Copy it into `server/.env` as
`SKILLPAY_CONTRACT_ID`.

The contract exposes exactly the four functions from the brief:
`create_challenge`, `fund_reward_pool`, `release_reward`, `get_challenge`,
plus `close_challenge` for cleanup. Rewards are escrowed in the contract's
own balance (not just bookkeeping) using the standard Stellar Asset Contract
(SAC) token interface, so `fund_reward_pool` performs a real transfer from
the mentor's wallet into the contract, and `release_reward` performs a real
transfer from the contract to the learner.

> ⚠️ I wrote and unit-tested this contract against the Soroban SDK 21.x API,
> but couldn't compile it in this sandbox (no Rust toolchain available here).
> Run `cargo test` yourself before deploying — if the SDK has moved since
> my knowledge cutoff, you may need to adjust a few method names.

## 2. Backend API

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # fill in MongoDB URI, JWT secret, contract ID, platform signing key
npm run seed              # optional: creates a demo mentor + one challenge
npm run dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:4000`. Key routes:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/signup` | Creates user, generates + Friendbot-funds a Stellar wallet |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | JWT login |
| `GET/POST /api/challenges` | Browse / create challenges |
| `POST /api/challenges/:id/fund` | Mentor escrows reward on-chain |
| `POST /api/submissions` | Learner submits project (+ optional Gemini AI review) |
| `PATCH /api/submissions/:id/approve` | Mentor approves → triggers `release_reward` on-chain |
| `GET /api/profile/me` / `/:id` | Private / public learner profile |
| `GET /api/profile/feed/recent` | Recent settlements, powers the dashboard ticker |

**Security note on wallet secrets:** for this MVP, each user's Stellar secret
key is generated server-side and stored (select:false field) so the backend
can sign `fund_reward_pool` / `release_reward` calls on the mentor's behalf
without requiring a browser wallet extension. This is fine for a testnet
demo but **not** how you'd do it in production — the next iteration should
move to client-side signing (e.g. Freighter wallet) so secret keys never
touch your server.

## 3. Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local    # or just export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:3000`. Built with Next.js App Router + Tailwind.
Design direction: a "ledger" aesthetic — rows separated by hairline rules
like a bank statement or git log, monospace for amounts/addresses, two
accent colors (gold = settled, slate = pending) instead of a single neon
accent, and a live-scrolling settlement ticker on the homepage as the
signature visual element.

## 4. Analytics & monitoring (required for submission)

- **PostHog**: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` in `web/.env.local`. Events
  already instrumented in the code: `challenge_viewed`, `challenge_created`,
  `wallet_connected`, `submission_made`, `reward_claimed`.
- **Sentry**: set `SENTRY_DSN` in `server/.env` and run
  `npm install @sentry/node` in `server/`. The error handler in
  `server/src/middleware/errorHandler.js` is already wired to forward
  exceptions once a DSN is present.

Take screenshots of both dashboards once you have real events flowing —
these are required in your submission, see the checklist below.

## 5. Getting your 10 real users

1. Run the seed script or post a real first challenge (e.g. "Build a
   Personal Portfolio — 50 XLM").
2. Share the signup link with classmates / your network. Each signup
   auto-creates and funds a wallet, so "onboarded" = "has a funded testnet
   wallet" with zero manual setup on their end.
3. After at least one real `release_reward` transaction per user, record
   it in `docs/wallet-proof.md` (template included) with their public key,
   amount, and tx hash — this is your wallet-interaction proof.
4. Send the feedback form (template in `docs/feedback-form.md`) and
   summarize responses in the same doc.

## Submission checklist mapping

| Requirement | Where it's satisfied |
|---|---|
| Production MVP, mobile responsive | `web/` — Tailwind responsive classes throughout; test at 320/768/1024px and screenshot |
| Loading + error states | Every data-fetching page (`challenges`, `dashboard`, `profile`, challenge detail) has explicit loading skeletons and error messages |
| 10 real users + wallet proof | `docs/wallet-proof.md` template — fill in after you onboard real users |
| User feedback | `docs/feedback-form.md` template — Google Form questions + summary table |
| Smart contracts on testnet | `contracts/skillpay-contract/` — deploy per instructions above, paste contract address here once deployed: `_____________` |
| 15+ meaningful commits | See suggested commit plan below |
| Public GitHub repo | Push this folder as-is |
| Analytics + monitoring | PostHog + Sentry, see section 4 |
| Demo video | Record a walkthrough: signup → wallet funded → mentor posts + funds challenge → learner submits → mentor approves → reward lands in learner wallet (check balance before/after) |
